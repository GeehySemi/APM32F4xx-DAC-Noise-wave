white noise generator 6.1 define STM32 microcontroller DAC provides users with a pseudo random code generator. According to the shift register on the use of ticks, 
before repeating sequences can be generated with the most number of 2 n - 1 power sequence.
White noise generators can also be used to produce electronic music, usually directly or as input to filters to form other types of noise signals. 
White noise generators are widely used in audio synthesis, often to reproduce the effects of percussion instruments such as cymbals, 
which have a high amount of noise in their frequency domain.White noise generators can be used in control engineering, 
as well as frequency response testing for amplifiers and electronic filters. 
White noise is a general-purpose synthetic noise source used for sound masking through tinnitus masking.
