&par Example Description

This example provides a example of how to use DAC channel 1(PA4) to output
voltage to ADC channel 0(PA0). The converted voltage of PA4 is detected by
ADC  channel 0 and displayed on serial assistant through USART1.

 -DAC generates voltage from 0V to 3.3V

 -when the voltage is greater than 3.1V, then LED2 turns on and LED3 turns off.
 -when the voltage is less than 0.8V, then LED2 turns off and LED3 turns on.
 -when the voltage is greater than 0.8V but less than 3.1V, then LED2 and LED3 turn on.

&par Hardware Description

connect DAC Channel1 (PA4) to ADC Channel 0 (PA0)

The USART1 is configured as follows:
    - TX:PA9, RX:PA10
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled
